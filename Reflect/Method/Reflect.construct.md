# Reflect.construct

## 1. Description

- The static Reflect.construct() method acts like the new operator, but as a function.
- Reflect.construct() allows you to invoke a constructor with a variable number of arguments.
- This would also be possible by using the spread syntax combined with the new operator.
- It is equivalent to calling new target(...args).
- It gives also the added option to specify a different prototype.
